# Over-Engineering A Website

Why build something in a manner that <i>doesn't</i> allow you to learn while you build?

My site - `jsore.com` - is a simple portfolio/blogging site I've decided to make, but packed with
technologies and created with an original mindset that I wanted to make this an opportunity to
really get my hands dirty with Node. Purposfully not being a simple place where some static files
get served, as is common with these kinds of sites.

Further, to account for the future implementation of a side-project, Break Room Ramen, a web app
I'll be creating for me and a few buddies to review unique flavors of ramen, this is gonna be a bit
overly fleshed out and thought through.
