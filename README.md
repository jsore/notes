I like to take notes
====================

As a self-learner with a fairly horrible memory, I have written and made a laughable attempt
at keeping track of a <b>ton</b> of notes on various "computer"-related subjects, in the
hopes that:<br>

<br>

<b>"The more I write, the more I digest"</b>

<br>

It worked for my Net+ along with the foundation of the rest of the stuff I know, so why should
I not keep that ball rolling?

<br>

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

<br>

Turns out, some shit is kinda hard to understand without some live examples and/or someone to
hold your hand throughout the portion of code review that I like to call <b>"What the hell is
going on"</b>

<br>

This is my first orchestrated attempt at keeping my notes organized since the inception of a project,
this project being a foray at managing a public full-stack Node.js web server, along
with a logically separated public DNS and DB server (TODO, for now).<br>

Until now my stack has been on a local only VBox VM with no version control other than renaming files.


### Additions

New projects I've started here:
- centos-webserver
    - my notes on spinng up a site, from server provision to custom DNS config, dev environemnt
      config, Node.js-related practices (I've never worked with Node before so I wanted a reason
      to dive head first into it) and 
- node-js (current project)
    - notes and supportive scripts for the book `Node.js 8 the Right Way`
