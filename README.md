I like to take notes
====================

As a self-learner with a fairly horrible memory, I have written and made a laughable attempt
at keeping track of a <b>ton</b> of notes on various "computer"-related subjects, in the
hopes that:<br>

<br>

    > The more I write, the more I digest

<br>

This is my first orchestrated attempt at keeping my notes organized since the inception of a project,
this project being a foray at managing a public full-stack Node.js web server, along
with a logically separated public DNS and DB server (TODO, for now).<br>

Until now my stack has been on a local only VBox VM with no version control other than renaming files.

### V2 - Altering Project Structure

The structure of this project....isn't ideal. I'm hand rolling a self-hosted
wiki, but that's still a work in progress, so I'll continue updating this repo
from the `v2` folder.

Current:

- Building Enterprise Applications
    - https://github.com/jsore/notes/tree/master/v2/enterprise-js

- Rediscovering JavaScript
    - https://github.com/jsore/notes/tree/master/v2/rediscovering-js

- Python Crash Course
    - https://github.com/jsore/notes/tree/master/v2/python-crash-course
