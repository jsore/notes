# I like to take notes

I have a ton of notes on various linux/development-related subjects.

This is my first attempt at keeping them organized since the inception of a project,
this project being a foray at managing a public full-stack Node.js web server, along
with public DNS and DB server. Until now my stack has been on a local only VBox VM.
