I like to take notes
====================

I have a ton of notes on various linux/development-related subjects.

This is my first attempt at keeping them organized since the inception of a project,
this project being a foray at managing a public full-stack Node.js web server, along
with public DNS and DB server. Until now my stack has been on a local only VBox VM.




# Handy dandy portable Cheat Sheet
## This is an `<h2>` tag
###### This is an `<h6>` tag

<br><br>
Use `<br>` tags to break up lines further than original limit
Take note of the spacing here
<br><br><br>

### Code block, JS syntax specified

```javascript
function test() {
 console.log("look maâ€™, no spaces");
}
```

<br>
And now `this should be an inline block` for code....inline
