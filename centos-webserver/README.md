## Building A Web Server
#### With CentOS 7, Apache, Let's Encrypt & Self-Hosted Custom DNS

Starting from the ground up, from domain name registration and provisioning a VM with
a server hosting company, this is my current process in creating a secure web server
with which to host my personal website.

> ##### Note to self - Proposed process for project:
> - Set .gitignore every file until sanitized of data that could be compromising
> - Port each section of original notes to individual files, sections separated
> - Copy a file to work on, scrub it, remove the copy from .gitignore, keeping the original
> ##### ToDo
> - [ ] gitignore
> - [ ] port main file
> - [ ] break down main file (to `.md`'s)
