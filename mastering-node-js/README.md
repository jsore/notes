# Mastering Node

Snippets & thoughts about Packt Publishing's "Mastering Node.js - Second Edition".

<br>

<b>Note</b>

These are just for personal use, I am not affiliated with Packt in any way. I just enjoy writing.

Not everything in the book will be documented, just things I thought were interesting, laid out in
my own words.

Supportive docs and code are rooted in this repo's `project-files` directory.

## The low-level

<br>

#### POSIX
Old, simple and well known definition for the standard API for Unix OS'es.

Node uses wrappers around POSIX for file I/O instead of reinventing the wheel, allowing for
greater familiarity for developers trained in other languages.

<br>

#### Threads and Events
System programmers access computing tasks via the thread, which Node mimics with a <b>single</b>
event loop-bound thread. Callbacks are utilized to have tasks enter/leave the execution context,
the event loop popping tasks into the context until the lowest level task has been executed. Events
are created by I/O operations generating them within data streams.

<br>

#### Standard C libraries
Node isn't having JavaScript actually doing the low-level work, JavaScript is calling down to
the C code version of the library you're using, which gets included and compiled into Node.

Again, the intention being to not reinvent the wheel.
